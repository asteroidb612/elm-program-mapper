# I don't want to include functions which are definied inside a function as functions which are needed to write a function.
Maybe I'm just picking from the top level definitions?
Or that's one subcategory? And I can expand from there like expanding by modules?
That also helps get rid of the arguments which are cluttering the diagram.
